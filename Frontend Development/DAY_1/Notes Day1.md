# ðŸš€ Sheryians Live Cohort â€“ Day 1 Notes

Welcome to my Sheryians Live Cohort journey! ðŸŒŸ Here are the notes from Day 1 of the bootcamp, where we explored the **Internet**, **Client-Server Architecture**, and **Web Hosting**.

## Topic 1: How the Internet Works

### 1.1 Brief History: Web 1.0 â†’ Web 3.0

**Web 1.0 (1990s â€“ early 2000s)** â€“ The "Read-Only" Web
- Websites were static with no interactivity.
- Built using HTML and CSS (no JavaScript).
- Users could only read content; there was no user engagement.
- No social media or real-time interactions.
- **Example**: Early Yahoo! pages, simple blogs.

**Web 2.0 (2004 â€“ Present)** â€“ The "Read-Write" Web
- Enabled dynamic and interactive experiences.
- Technologies like AJAX and JavaScript allowed live updates without page reloads.
- Social media, e-commerce, and cloud applications emerged.
- Users could generate content (comments, reviews, blog posts, real-time chats).
- **Example**: Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Amazon.

**Web 3.0 (Emerging)** â€“ The "Decentralized" Web
- Uses blockchain technology to ensure decentralization.
- AI-driven and privacy-focused to give users more control over data.
- **Example**: Cryptocurrencies, smart contracts, decentralized apps (Ethereum, Filecoin).

### 1.2 Basics of Computer Communication & Data Transmission

- The internet sends data in **packets**, which are small chunks of information.
- Each packet has:
  - **Header** (destination and sender information).
  - **Payload** (actual data being transferred).
- Uses **TCP/IP** protocols to ensure data reaches the right destination.

### 1.3 Types of Communication

- **Wired (Ethernet, Fiber Optics)** â€“ More stable and faster; used in offices.
- **Wireless (Wi-Fi, 5G)** â€“ Provides flexibility but can be slower.

### 1.4 Domain Names, IP Addresses, MAC Addresses, and Routing

- **IP Address (Internet Protocol Address)**:
  - A unique number assigned to every internet-connected device.
  - **IPv4** (xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx) has 4.3 billion addresses.
  - **IPv6** provides a larger address space for the future.

- **MAC Address (Media Access Control)**:
  - A unique identifier assigned to a deviceâ€™s network adapter.
  - **Example**: 00:1A:2B:3C:4D:5E.
  - Used within local networks but not on the broader internet.

- **Domain Names** (Example: www.google.com):
  - Human-friendly names mapped to IP addresses via **DNS** (Domain Name System).
  - DNS servers resolve domain names into IP addresses.

- **Routing**:
  - Routers and gateways direct traffic efficiently.
  - Packets take different routes to reach the destination efficiently.

### 1.5 Overview of ISP & DNS Functionality

- **Internet Service Providers (ISP)**:
  - Companies like Jio, Airtel, BSNL provide internet access.
  - They act as intermediaries between users and the global internet.

- **How DNS Works**:
  - A user types **www.google.com** in a browser.
  - The browser contacts a **DNS server** to get the IP address.
  - The DNS translates the domain into an IP (e.g., 142.250.183.206).
  - The browser connects to the websiteâ€™s server using the IP.
