## Topic 2: Client-Server Architecture

### 2.1 Introduction to the Client-Server Model

- **What is a Client**:
  - A userâ€™s device (computer, phone, tablet) that requests data from a server.
  - **Examples**: Web browsers, mobile apps.

- **What is a Server**:
  - A powerful computer that stores and delivers content or services.
  - **Examples**: Web servers, API servers, database servers.

- **Example**:
  - A client is like a customer at a restaurant, and the server is like a waiter bringing food from the kitchen.

### 2.2 Differences Between Client and Server

- **Example**:
  - You visit YouTube â†’ The client sends a request.
  - The YouTube server processes it and responds with videos.

### 2.3 HTTP Request/Response Cycle

- **How It Works**:
  - Client sends a request (e.g., GET /index.html).
  - Server processes the request.
  - Server responds with data.
  - Client displays the content.

- **HTTP Methods**:
  - **GET** â†’ Retrieve data.
  - **POST** â†’ Send data (forms, logins).
  - **PUT** â†’ Update data.
  - **DELETE** â†’ Remove data.

- **Example**:
  - A restaurant order â€“ You (client) order pizza (GET), the kitchen (server) prepares it, and you receive it.

### 2.4 Frontend vs Backend, Static vs Dynamic Websites

- **Frontend (Client-Side)**:
  - Code that runs in the browser.
  - **Technologies**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

- **Backend (Server-Side)**:
  - Code that runs on the server.
  - **Technologies**: Node.js, Python, PHP.

- **Static vs Dynamic Websites**:
  - A static website is like a printed book, while a dynamic website is like a news website that updates regularly.

### 2.5 Basics of Web Hosting

- **Web Hosting** stores websites for online access.
- **Examples**: Shared Hosting, VPS, Cloud Hosting.
- **Popular Providers**: GoDaddy, Hostinger, AWS, Netlify.

- **Analogy**:
